        "abstract": "Biological oxygen demand (BOD5) is an indicator used to monitor water quality. However, the standard process of measuring BOD5 is time consuming and could delay crucial mitigation works in the event of pollution. To solve this problem, this study employed multiple machine learning (ML) methods such as random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) to train a best model that can accurately predict the BOD5 values in water samples based on other physical and chemical properties of the water. The training parameters were optimized using genetic algorithm (GA) and feature selection was made using the sequential feature selection (SFS) method. The proposed machine learning framework was first tested on a public dataset (Waterbase). The MLP method produced the best model, with an R2 score of 0.7672791942775417, relative mean squared error (MSE) and relative mean absolute error (MAE) of approximately 15\\\\%. Feature importance calculations indicated that chemical oxygen demand (CODCr), ammonium and nitrate are features that highly correlate to BOD5. In the field study with a small private dataset consisting of water samples collected from two different lakes in Jiangsu Province of China, the trained model was found to have a similar range of prediction error (around 15\\\\%), a similar relative MAE (around 14\\\\%) and achieved about 6\\\\% better relative RMSE.",

        "abstract": "Water saturation is imperative in the evaluation of hydrocarbon reserves available. However, it is challenging to accurately determine the water saturation of complex reservoirs using conventional techniques. This is due to the fact that the conventional models are unable to fully account for the heterogeneity of the reservoir and their results are highly influenced by factors such as type of data, approach and shale distribution. Moreover, most computational intelligence methods developed to estimate water saturation have neglected the relationship that can exist between input variables and their impact on model performance. This is because well log parameters can exhibit relationships among each other which leads to the presence of multiple collinearities and increases the complexity of the model. Therefore, this paper for the first time adopted principal component analysis (PCA) as a dimensionality reduction method to improve the performance of optimized least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system-subtractive clustering method (ANFIS-SCM). The experimental results clearly depicted a superior performance from PCA based LSSVM (PCA-LSSVM) during training and testing. Also, PCA minimized the overfitting experienced by ANFIS-SCM by improving the model's generalization ability. On the whole, PCA-LSSVM provided the least prediction error and outperformed PCA based ANFIS-SCM (PCA-ANFIS-SCM) when estimating water saturation.",

        "abstract": "Empirical data from a 6-month mesocosms experiment were used to assess the ability and performance of two machine learning (ML) models, including artificial neural network (NN) and random forest (RF), to predict temporal bioavailability changes of complex chemical mixtures in contaminated soils amended with compost or biochar. From the predicted bioavailability data, toxicity response for relevant ecological receptors was then forecasted to establish environmental risk implications and determine acceptable end-point remediation. The dataset corresponds to replicate samples collected over 180 days and analysed for total and bioavailable petroleum hydrocarbons and heavy metals/metalloids content. Further to this, a range of biological indicators including bacteria count, soil respiration, microbial community fingerprint, seeds germination, earthworm's lethality, and bioluminescent bacteria were evaluated to inform the environmental risk assessment. Parameters such as soil type, amendment (biochar and compost), initial concentration of individual compounds, and incubation time were used as inputs of the ML models. The relative importance of the input variables was also analysed to better understand the drivers of temporal changes in bioavailability and toxicity. It showed that toxicity changes can be driven by multiple factors (combined effects), which may not be accounted for in classical linear regression analysis (correlation). The use of ML models could improve our understanding of rate-limiting processes affecting the freely available fraction (bioavailable) of contaminants in soil, therefore contributing to mitigate potential risks and to inform appropriate response and recovery methods.",

        "abstract": "Algal atypical productivity, also called eutrophication, is a process where the phosphorus content in the water, together with aquatic flora, increases, causing high Chlorophyll levels and affecting the water quality and its possible applications. Therefore, it is important to be able to anticipate such circumstance to avoid subsequent hazards. In this paper, a model that estimates the conditions where an abnormal growth of algae in reservoirs and lakes takes place is built. This method combines artificial bee colony and support vector machines algorithms to predict the eutrophication taking into account physical-chemical and biological data sampled in the Englishmen Lake and posterior analysis in a laboratory. The support vector machines parameters are tuned by means of the artificial bee colony algorithm, improving the accuracy of the procedure. For comparison sake, two other methods have been used to construct additional models, the M5 model tree and multilayer perceptron network. Two objectives are covered by this study: the forecasting of the algal proliferation by means of the model and, the ranking of the relative importance of the independent variables. Indeed, coefficients of determination of 0.92 for the Chlorophyll and 0.90 for the Total phosphorus concentrations were obtained using this hybrid method that optimizes the regression parameters. Furthermore, the results obtained with M5 model tree and multilayer perceptron network techniques were clearly worse. Finally, conclusions of this work are drawn in the final section.",

        "abstract": "Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) remains a worldwide public health issue. However, epidemiological studies on the chronic health impacts of PM2.5 in the developing countries are hindered by the lack of monitoring data. Despite the recent development of using satellite remote sensing to predict ground-level PM2.5 concentrations in China, methods for generating reliable historical PM2.5 exposure, especially prior to the construction of PM2.5 monitoring network in 2013, are still very rare. In this study, a high-performance machine-learning model was developed directly at monthly level to estimate PM2.5 levels in North China Plain. We developed a random forest model using the latest Multi-angle implementation of atmospheric correction (MAIAC) aerosol optical depth (AOD), meteorological parameters, land cover and ground PM2.5 measurements from 2013 to 2015. A multiple imputation method was applied to fill the missing values of AOD. We used 10-fold cross-validation (CV) to evaluate model performance and a separate time period, January 2016 to December 2016, was used to validate our model's capability of predicting historical PM2.5 concentrations. The overall model CV R2 and relative prediction error (RPE) were 0.88 and 18.7%, respectively. Validation results beyond the modeling period (2013\u20132015) shown that this model can accurately predict historical PM2.5 concentrations at the monthly (R2\u202f",

        "abstract": "Intense demand for water in the Central Valley of California and related increases in groundwater nitrate concentration threaten the sustainability of the groundwater resource. To assess contamination risk in the region, we developed a hybrid, non-linear, machine learning model within a statistical learning framework to predict nitrate contamination of groundwater to depths of approximately 500m below ground surface. A database of 145 predictor variables representing well characteristics, historical and current field and landscape-scale nitrogen mass balances, historical and current land use, oxidation/reduction conditions, groundwater flow, climate, soil characteristics, depth to groundwater, and groundwater age were assigned to over 6000 private supply and public supply wells measured previously for nitrate and located throughout the study area. The boosted regression tree (BRT) method was used to screen and rank variables to predict nitrate concentration at the depths of domestic and public well supplies. The novel approach included as predictor variables outputs from existing physically based models of the Central Valley. The top five most important predictor variables included two oxidation/reduction variables (probability of manganese concentration to exceed 50ppb and probability of dissolved oxygen concentration to be below 0.5ppm), field-scale adjusted unsaturated zone nitrogen input for the 1975 time period, average difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration during the years 1971\u20132000, and 1992 total landscape nitrogen input. Twenty-five variables were selected for the final model for log-transformed nitrate. In general, increasing probability of anoxic conditions and increasing precipitation relative to potential evapotranspiration had a corresponding decrease in nitrate concentration predictions. Conversely, increasing 1975 unsaturated zone nitrogen leaching flux and 1992 total landscape nitrogen input had an increasing relative impact on nitrate predictions. Three-dimensional visualization indicates that nitrate predictions depend on the probability of anoxic conditions and other factors, and that nitrate predictions generally decreased with increasing groundwater age.",

        "abstract": "Due to the health impacts caused by exposures to air pollutants in urban areas, monitoring and forecasting of air quality parameters have become popular as an important topic in atmospheric and environmental research today. The knowledge on the dynamics and complexity of air pollutants behavior has made artificial intelligence models as a useful tool for a more accurate pollutant concentration prediction. This paper focuses on an innovative method of daily air pollution prediction using combination of Support Vector Machine (SVM) as predictor and Partial Least Square (PLS) as a data selection tool based on the measured values of CO concentrations. The CO concentrations of Rey monitoring station in the south of Tehran, from Jan. 2007 to Feb. 2011, have been used to test the effectiveness of this method. The hourly CO concentrations have been predicted using the SVM and the hybrid PLS\u2013SVM models. Similarly, daily CO concentrations have been predicted based on the aforementioned four years measured data. Results demonstrated that both models have good prediction ability; however the hybrid PLS\u2013SVM has better accuracy. In the analysis presented in this paper, statistic estimators including relative mean errors, root mean squared errors and the mean absolute relative error have been employed to compare performances of the models. It has been concluded that the errors decrease after size reduction and coefficients of determination increase from 56 to 81% for SVM model to 65\u201385% for hybrid PLS\u2013SVM model respectively. Also it was found that the hybrid PLS\u2013SVM model required lower computational time than SVM model as expected, hence supporting the more accurate and faster prediction ability of hybrid PLS\u2013SVM model.",
